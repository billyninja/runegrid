# RuneGrid - gamedev self challenge

Every day for, about a week I'll **try to** rewrite the same game from scratch, within 1 hour.
I'll try not to cheat and avoid copy&paste code from the web as much as possible. The only heritage I'm going to pass from day-to-day is a scrapbook.legacy textfile. Which will be versioned and I'll keep it under 30 lines and 80 columns.

## Game Design Idea
Something involving a grid and nordic runes, that does **not** play as PuzzleQuest/CadyCrush/Bejewled or Tetris.
For stater I'll just do some technical-tasks (rendering, input-handling, animation etc.) and wait for a game design idea as it goes.
